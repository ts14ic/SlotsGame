Slots Game
==========

A small prototype for a simple slots machine game

The slots package has different data classes and a SlotsGame interface.    
The default implementation is a LocalSlotsGame, that can work on a local machine,  
but the interface can be overridden to have a remote based game (hence using a Listener and not a return type)
